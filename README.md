## Work Experience
    University of New Mexico, College of Nursing
        Research Assistant: Data Analysis & Visualization (2022 – Present)
* Played a crucial role in developing the underlying datasets to build a Geographic Information System (GIS) map to help Universities and Hospitals identify weak points in Disaster Preparedness within the United States, using existing government databases (CENSUS, FEMA) and other compiled data.
* Developed a python program to create a database of all CCNE & NLN nursing accredited schools across the nation. Furthermore, I utilized Google’s Geocoding API to list the latitude and longitude of all CCNE or NLN accredited schools.
* Published a research article with my collogues in the International Journal of Environmental Research & Public Health, titled “Healthcare Impacts Associated with Federally Declared Disasters—Hurricanes Gustave and Ike.”

## Notable Projects
```Food For Kids (Java + Apache POI)```

* Designed and programmed a Java automation script for creating weekly nutritional menus on Microsoft Excel for a local business.
* Program was designed to handle multiple input files containing dozens of food options. Program randomizes three meals for each day of the week, including beverages, snacks, proteins, grains, vegetables, and fruits. Final output written onto an MS Excel Spreadsheet (using Apache POI) with proper formatting and data. Program assures that no child gets served the same meal twice in a row. 
* System adheres to state and federal guidelines for daily nutrition.
* Automation system later updated and expanded for other surrounding independent daycare businesses in the Albuquerque area. 

```Tour de France (C)```
* Program organizes raw data from the final classification of Tour de France riders into various formatting files. Data can be sorted by team, country, or by classification. 
* Program is designed to handle thousands of data entries with ease.

```Book & Author (Java)```
* Is a program designed to create, store, and manage hundreds of books, as if it was the backend system to a library. Program is also designed to handle minor errors, such as checking out more books than those available.
* Program can recognize total copies in library, number of books checked out, print library status, add books (unique), add books (copies), check out books, check in books, as well as list books by title/author. 
* Achieved proficiency utilizing constructors, methods, objects, and classes throughout the scope of this program

```Um, the presentation tracker (Python)```
* Utilizing Apple’s native speech recognition software, “Um, the presentation tracker” listens to a presenter’s speech in real time and auto-detects any flawed speech habits. Program defines “flawed speech habits” as being universally agreed upon “no-no’s” when presenting, such as using the word “um”. Gives a total count of how many errors a presenter made for each flawed speech habit word.
